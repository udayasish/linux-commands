Node Healt of Your VM:


In a shell script, open debug mode for seeing all the commands before their execution:
  set -x

To check all the processes running in your VM:
  ps -ef     (full processes)
  ps         (some processes only)

To check only the processes that matches a keyword:
  ps -ef | grep "key_word"
  Here, the pipe (|) is sinding the first command's output to the second command
  i.e. the output of ps -ef is sent to grep "key_word" using the | operator.
